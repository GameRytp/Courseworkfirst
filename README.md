# Courseworkfirst

================

Hi! In this repos. I'll share my first coursework (for the first cource).
It was based on a C++ with using object oriented programming.
Well, I have nothing to say more. The only thing that the program, together with the article, scored 92 points out of 100

PS. I know that there are a lot of cons in this prog. I was completely inexperienced. Nevertheless, I see no point in finishing the program due to the lack of interest in it.
